# mc-utinstapoll
Very short and minimal js for alerting when instapoll shows up on videostreams. 
Notice this won't choose or any answers for you, it will simple make a very annoying beep when there is a poll. 
You can change the audio or timeout duration anything.
Just paste this on to any tool like tampermonkey and should be fine.

Doesn't have any answering or choosing answer features since it wasn't very applicable for me at the time,
but I will update in future if I do need it or something like that
